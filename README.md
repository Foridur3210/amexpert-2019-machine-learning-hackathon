Discount marketing and coupon usage are very widely used promotional techniques to attract new customers and to retain & reinforce loyalty of existing customers. The measurement of a consumer’s propensity towards coupon usage and the prediction of the redemption behaviour are crucial parameters in assessing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign.

ABC’s promotions are shared across various channels including email, notifications, etc. A number of these campaigns include coupon discounts that are offered for a specific product/range of products. The retailer would like the ability to predict whether customers redeem the coupons received across channels, which will enable the retailer’s marketing team to accurately design coupon construct, and develop more precise and targeted marketing strategies.
